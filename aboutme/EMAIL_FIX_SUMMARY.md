# EmailJS Fix Summary

## Problem
The contact form in the deployed application wasn't working because it was trying to use environment variables for EmailJS configuration, but these variables weren't available in the GitHub Pages deployment environment.

## Solution
1. Implemented a hardcoded configuration approach for EmailJS
2. Removed reliance on environment variables
3. Enhanced error handling in the contact form component
4. Updated GitHub Actions workflow to remove environment variables
5. Added validation script and documentation

## Files Changed
- src/config/emailjs.js - Enhanced documentation about hardcoded approach
- src/config/README.md - Added new documentation file explaining the approach
- src/components/ContactForm.vue - Removed duplicate initialization, improved error handling
- src/main.js - Improved EmailJS initialization
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Removed environment variables from build process
- DEPLOY.md - Updated deployment instructions
- Removed .env.production - No longer needed
- Added validation script src/config/validate-emailjs-config.js
- Updated package.json to add validation script

## Next Steps
1. Test the contact form in the deployed environment
2. Verify that emails are being sent correctly
3. Consider implementing additional error reporting if needed

## Security Note
EmailJS public keys are designed to be exposed on the client side and have limited capabilities. This approach is secure for this type of application.
